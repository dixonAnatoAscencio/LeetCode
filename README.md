#Big (O) - Time and Space Complexity 

Time complexity: describes the amount of time necessary to execute an algorithm 

Space Complexity: describes amount of memory or space utilized by an algorithm/program

Both - asymptotically
In computer science, big O notations is used to describe algorithms according to how fast they run (time complexity) or how much space they take (space complexity) as the input size grows.

Technical Definition: Big O is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behaviour of a function when the argument tends towards a paticular value of infinity

Why do we need Big O? - Big O notation helps us understand how the performance of an algorithm changes as the size of the input grows, providing a simple way to compare and analyse different algorithms' efficiency
